## 💼 Project Summary

This project analyzes income and employment data in Canada to uncover patterns across different demographics like gender, education, province, and immigration status. Using a real-world dataset, we answer key questions about income distribution and employment types.

No coding knowledge is required to understand the findings (our results are presented with clear visuals and easy-to-follow explanations).

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Provincial Differences:** Income levels vary significantly across provinces. Province 59 shows the highest average income ($112,899), while Province 11 has the lowest ($93,999).
- **Income After Tax:** Income after tax is significantly lower than before-tax earnings, highlighting the role of taxation in take-home pay.
- **Income Sources:** Salaries are the primary source of income, but pensions and investments also play a notable role, especially for older individuals.
- **Gender Gap:** A clear gender-based income disparity exists, with males earning more on average than females across most provinces.
- **Education Pays Off:** Individuals with higher levels of education (e.g., university degrees) consistently earn more than those with only high school diplomas.
- **Immigration Impact:** Immigrants tend to earn less on average than non-immigrants, indicating possible socioeconomic barriers.
- **Family Size & Child Benefits:** Larger families receive more in child benefits, but also show greater dependency on these supports.
- **Self-Employment:** A small but significant percentage of individuals rely primarily on self-employment income.
- **Employment Insurance (EI):** Certain provinces show higher EI claims relative to earnings, suggesting regional differences in employment stability.
